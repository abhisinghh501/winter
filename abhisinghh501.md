## Summary

### Smart mirror
Raspberry Pi can be used to create a smart mirror that can display information such as the time, weather, news, calendar, and more. Some of the smart mirror also could include facial recognition, voice control, and other advanced features.
The Raspberry Pi is responsible for running the software that powers the smart mirror, including a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the various features of the mirror. The GUI is typically displayed on a touch screen that is mounted behind the mirror, which allows users to interact with the mirror as if it were a computer screen.
Additionally, the smart mirror could be integrated with other smart devices in the home, such as lights and thermostats, to allow for control of those devices through the mirror.

### DIY Multifunction device
We are thrilled to embark on an ambitious project to design and build a portable, multifunctional device that will have the ability to assist in a wide range of applications, as well as perform penetration testing on both smart and non-smart devices in the home environment. Our interest in cybersecurity began when we participated in a competition, where we gained an understanding of the digital aspects of this field. However, our curiosity and passion for the subject matter led us to discover the Flipper Zero, an innovative tool that combines an entry-level software-defined radio, near-field communication, radio-frequency identification, and access to general-purpose input/output pins. We hope to utilize this device to expand our knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, not only in digital applications but also in physical ones. Additionally, we are eager to learn the art of soldering and creating prototyping boards, which we plan to use for testing air quality, measuring distances, and sniffing packets, among other things.

## Plan 

### Smart mirror
Gather Materials: You will need a Raspberry Pi computer, a mirror, a touch screen display, a frame or enclosure to hold the mirror and display, and various other components such as a power supply, cables, and a camera (optional).
Assemble the Hardware: Mount the touch screen display behind the mirror in the frame or enclosure. Connect the Raspberry Pi to the display, power supply, and any other components. Make sure everything is securely fastened and properly connected.
Install the Operating System: You will need to install an operating system on the Raspberry Pi. The most common choice for smart mirrors is Raspbian, a version of Linux that is optimized for the Raspberry Pi.
Install the Smart Mirror Software: There are several open-source software packages available for creating smart mirrors, such as MagicMirror and SmartMirror.js. These software packages provide the graphical user interface (GUI) and various features for the smart mirror.
Configure the Software: Once the software is installed, you will need to configure it to display the information and features you want on your smart mirror. This may include things like the time, weather, news, calendar, etc.
Customize the GUI: You can customize the GUI by adding widgets, modules, and other features. You can also adjust the layout, color scheme and text size to fit your preferences.
Finalize: Once everything is set up and configured, you can test it to make sure everything is working correctly. After that, you can install the mirror in the final location and use it.

### DIY Multifunction device
We have a three-step plan to achieve our goal of building a portable multifunction device that can assist in general applications as well as penetration testing the smart/not-smart devices around the home. First, we plan to acquire a Flipper Zero and take the time to become well-versed in its hardware and software development kits. This will allow us to fully understand and utilize the capabilities of this powerful tool. Second, we will invest in a soldering iron and prototyping boards, which will enable us to attach various chips, such as the BME680, to the GPIO headers on the Flipper Zero. This will allow us to easily monitor air quality on the go. Additionally, we plan to use the HC-SR04 chip for ultrasonic distance measuring. Third, we will solder the chosen chips onto the prototyping boards and write software that can convert the chip's output data into a readable format for humans, and display it on the Flipper Zero's screen. This will allow us to easily interpret and utilize the data gathered by the device.
